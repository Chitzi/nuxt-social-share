- open an issue to discuss your proposed bugfix or new feature, before even starting to work on the actual code. This is required to make sure that your effort will be put into good use by receiving a preliminary feedback and indications about how to work on it, and in case of new features, if they are in scope for the project and actually needed.
- provide concise but informative and understandable description about your contributions.
